# Pancake: Developer Command Line Tool

Pancake is a command line tool designed to streamline your project management workflow. It simplifies and makes it easy to sync multiple projects from remote repositories, helps in building and running projects on a local machine, and allows for the installation, uninstallation, and updating of development software and tools. 

```bash
pancake project list                  # View list of all projects you are working on
pancake project sync                  # Sync multiple projects from the remote repository 
pancake project build <project_name>  # Build a project
pancake project run <project_name>  # Start a project on the local machine
pancake project monitor               # Show details about the port, process PID, and uptime
```
It keeps all project files and tools in one place and stores all configurations in the pancake.yml file. Sharing this single file enables the sharing of your entire developer setup, making backups and migration from one machine to another easy.

For migration and sharing projects, just copy pancake.yml to your user home location and run:
```bash
pancake init
```
Everything your project needs will be installed. All the build and run configurations will already be in the configuration file, and it will sync the project from your remote repository all at once.


Another feature in development is Pancake GPT, which allows users to write commands in natural language and convert them into actual commands. It utilizes GPT models to understand the user's natural language input, interpret it, create a corresponding command, and execute it.

```bash
pancake gpt <user_description_of_command>
```

## Features:
1. Single location for all configuration and project files
2. Consistent set of commands across operating systems
3. Simplified commands for running and building projects with single commands and writing configurations only once
